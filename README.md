Welcome! I'm Paul Brook, a Senior Software Engineer with over 20 years experience, and here are some of the things I'm working on:

- [1brc](https://github.com/broop/1brc): I'm interested in achieving a sub 10 second result using only "common" techniques and builtin Java apis.
- [little-schemer](https://github.com/broop/little-schemer): the code I wrote while working through "The Little Schemer", includes multiple versions of the same functions, as developed in the text.
- [schemish](https://github.com/broop/schemish): a Scheme interpreter (in Python) based on all (and only!) the Scheme you need to run the code in The Little Schemer.
- [codecrafters-grep-python](https://github.com/broop/codecrafters-grep-python): Grep in Python on Codecrafters. Includes backreferences. Based on Rob Pike's idea, not NFA etc.
- [codecrafter-grep-c](https://github.com/broop/codecrafters-grep-c): Base funtionality only. Extensions are in the Python version.
- [codecrafters-grep-zig](https://github.com/broop/codecrafters-grep-zig): Base funtionality only. Extensions are in the Python version.
- codecrafters-kafka-java: Kafka on Codecrafters implementing some functionality including listing topics and partitions, plus basic consuming and producing of records.
