Welcome!

Here are some of the things I'm working on:
- 1brc: I'm interested in achieving a sub 10 second result using only "common" apis and ideas. Meaning no Unsafe or external tools such as GraalVm. Although I love bit-hacking, and enjoy reading some of the code employing those strategies in the 1brc solutions, I also consider it very difficult to maintain and hard to consider stable for example, I am sure that some input would end up breaking the code and would not be very keen on trying to fix it.
- ear-training: A long term project for developing tonal and atonal ear training (aka auditory development) exercises of various kinds. Some based on randomness, some on Markov processes, and some utilizing deep learning techniques.
- little-schemer: the code I wrote while working through "The Little Schemer" book along with many versions of the same functions that I ended up writing. All in one giant Racket source file.
- crafting-python: My implementation of Crafting Interpreters (the first part) in Python
