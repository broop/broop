Welcome!

Here are some of the things I'm working on:
- 1brc: I'm interested in achieving a sub 10 second result using only "common" techniques and builtin Java apis.
- little-schemer: the code I wrote while working through "The Little Schemer" book, along with many versions of the same functions that I ended up writing. Quite verbose.
- schemish: - Scheme interpreter (in Python) based on all (and only!) the Scheme you need to run the code in The Little Schemer.
- codecrafters-grep-python: Grep in Python on Codecrafters. Includes backreferences. Based on Rob Pike's idea, not NFA etc.
- codecrafters-grep-java: Grep in Java on Codecrafters - a different approach than the Python version, but originally based on it!
- codecrafter-grep-c: Base funtionality only. Extensions are in the Python and Java versions.
- codecrafters-grep-zig: Base funtionality only. Extensions are in the Python and Java versions.
- codecrafters-kafka-java: Kafka on Codecrafters implementing some functionality including listing topics and partitions, plus basic consuming and producing of records.
