Welcome!

Here are some of the things I'm working on:
- 1brc: I'm interested in achieving a sub 10 second result using only "common" techniques and apis.
- little-schemer: the code I wrote while working through "The Little Schemer" book along with many versions of the same functions that I ended up writing. 
- schemish: - Scheme interpreter based on all (and only!) the Scheme you need to run the code in The Little Schemer.
- codecrafter-grep-c: Base funtionality only. Extenions are in the Python and Java versions.
- codecrafters-grep-zig: Base funtionality only. Extenions are in the Python and Java versions.
- codecrafters-grep-python: Grep in Python on Codecrafters.
- codecrafters-greo-java: Grep in Java on Codecrafters - a different approach than the Python version.
- codecrafters-kafka-java: Toy Kafka which you can produce and consume from.
- tla+ coming soon...
