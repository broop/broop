Welcome!

Here are some of the things I'm working on:
- 1brc: I'm interested in achieving a sub 10 second result using only "common" apis and ideas. Meaning no Unsafe or external tools such as GraalVm. Although I love bit-hacking, and enjoy reading some of the code employing those strategies in the 1brc solutions, I also consider it very difficult to maintain and hard to consider stable for example, I am sure that some input would end up breaking the code and would not be very keen on trying to fix it.
- 1brc in Python using mmap and the same ideas in my Java solution based on multiprocessing
- little-schemer: the code I wrote while working through "The Little Schemer" book along with many versions of the same functions that I ended up writing. All in one giant Racket source file.
- [codecrafter-grep-c][https://github.com/broop/codecrafters-grep-c]: Base funtionality only. Extenions are in the Python and Java versions. 
- codecrafters-grep-python: Grep in Python on Codecrafters
- codecrafters-greo-java: Grep in Java on Codecrafters 
- zero-hero: My code from the Neural Networks: Zero to Hero courses at https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html
- tla+ coming soon...
- raft-python ... with a kv store fully linearizable and fault-tolerant. Maelstrom (Jepsen) testing integration.
